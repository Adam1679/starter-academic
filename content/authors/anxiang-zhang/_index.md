Hola! My name **is Anxiang (Adam) Zhang**, a master student in Carnegie Mellon. I'm currently looking for **PhD opportunities in Fall 2021.**

I'm a teaching assistant for [Introduction To Deep Learning](https://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/F20/index.html) by [Bhiksha Raj](http://mlsp.cs.cmu.edu/people/bhiksha/). My current research interest involves Text Mining, Knowledge Mining and Deep Learning. Also, I'm currently interested in the application of graph neural networks in cross-modality areas, e.g., Visual Question Answering. 

During the master student, I also worked closely with (David Garlan)[https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~garlan/] on exploring the visualization and interpretation of game theory and its application in defending security attacks.

Previously, I had a Bachelor in Economics in [Research Institute of Economics and Management](https://e.swufe.edu.cn/RESEARCH.htm) of Southwestern University of Finance and Economics. (Shock?) I worked with Yu Zhao on Knowledge Graph completion. I published this papaer as first co-author in ACL 2020. 

Besides research in text mining, I'm also a mix background student who has wide interests in economics and quantitative trading and playing Texas hold 'em.
