summary: "**Knowledge graph (KG)** entity typing aims at inferring possible
  missing entity type instances in KG, which is a very significant but still
  under-explored subtask of knowledge graph completion. In this paper, we
  propose a novel approach for KG entity typing which is trained by jointly
  utilizing local typing knowledge from existing entity type assertions and
  global triple knowledge in KGs. Specifically, we present two distinct
  knowledge-driven effective mechanisms of entity type inference. Accordingly,
  we build two novel embedding models to realize the mechanisms. Afterward, a
  joint model via connecting them is used to infer missing entity type
  instances, which favors inferences that agree with both entity type instances
  and triple knowledge in KGs. Experimental results on two real-world datasets
  (Freebase and YAGO) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanisms
  and models for improving KG entity typing."
